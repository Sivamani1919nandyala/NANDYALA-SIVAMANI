## Tandemloop Screening Test

### Language Used: Java

### Tool: VS CODE

Problem-1: Calculator using Class

Approach:

     -Created a class Calculator with methods for add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
     -Took user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
     -Used conditionals to call the appropriate method and return the result.

Problem-2: Generate First N Odd Numbers

Approach:

     -Read an integer N from the user.
     -Used a loop to generate the first N odd numbers using the formula 2*i + 1.
     -Printed the odd numbers in a comma-separated format.
         
Problem-3: Generate Odd Numbers (if a is odd, else a-1)

Approach:

     -Took input a from the user.
     -If a is odd → generated a odd numbers.
     -If a is even → generated a-1 odd numbers.
     -Used the formula 2*i + 1 inside a loop to print.
         
Problem-4: Count Multiples of 1–9 in a List

Approach:

     -Given an array of integers.
     -Created a LinkedHashMap<Integer, Integer> to count how many numbers are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.
     -For each element, looped through 1 to 9 and checked divisibility.
     -Preserved output order and printed result in {key: value} format.
